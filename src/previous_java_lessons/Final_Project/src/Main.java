class Main {
// * 4 Pillars of OOP
// * Must create and use at least 3 Constructors
// * Must have at least 4 methods
//The methods(void, static void) will be as follows:
	//the name of the car and it's specifications, what it uses for power, where was it made, 0-60 mph time, also price of it
// * Must include a section to get responses from User
	//this will be like scanner(System.in) where they will write, or pick a car, then it will ask what would you like to know, maybe 
	//they just want something specific, like only price, then it will be like choose the car and it will print out whatever info required
// * Must contain a switch statement
	
// * Must handle at least 1 exception
	//If they write a car that does not exist on the list, the exception will be, sorry, pick a car from the available list, and list again
// * Project must include at least 3 Classes
	//the classes are mustangGT, Tesla, toyotaPrius
// * Use one of the Collections structures.
	//ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>(); basically an ArrayList
// * Use a loop to traverse through your Collection structure that you chose and modify,// * organize, or return values from the iteration. 
// * ex. Sort my structure, Search, find and return object 
/* So this is the idea
 * write a project of cars, electric, hybrid, or gas classes:Tesla class, Toyota Prius class, Mustang GT class... three classes there
 * the project will give like a meaningful idea of what the cars are, Tesla is electric car, time of 0-60mph, etc.
 * constructor is public Tesla
 * classes will be public class Tesla
 * if someone writes in scanner give me the car specifications of any other car than the ones mentioned it will throw an error and say something
 * like, oh, you can only choose these three cars
 * I need a while loop, where after everything is done, it will ask which other car would you like to pick
